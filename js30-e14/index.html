    // newTeam[4] = "Swyaze";

    // now here is the problem!

    // console.log(players)
    // console.log(newTeam)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const newTeam2 = players.slice();

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Ren Gie',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const leader = person;
    // leader.number = 10;
    // console.log(person)
    // console.log(leader)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const lead2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 10, age: 23})
    console.log(person)
    console.log(lead2)

    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const lead3 = {...person}
    lead3.name = "Nul Lan"

    console.log(lead3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
